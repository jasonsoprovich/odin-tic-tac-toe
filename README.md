The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe

This project is a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) curriculum. Key features include:

- Game Board Management: The game board is encapsulated within a `Gameboard` object, storing the state of the 3x3 grid.

- Player Representation: Two player objects are created, each assigned a marker ('X' or 'O').

- Game Flow Control: A central object manages the game's progression, including player turns and determining game outcomes.

- Console-Based Logic: Initial game logic is implemented to run in the browser's console, focusing on core functionality before integrating with the DOM.

- DOM Interaction: After establishing console functionality, the game is extended to allow players to interact with the board through the browser interface, rendering the game state and capturing player input via the DOM.

This project emphasizes modular design patterns in JavaScript, particularly the use of objects and factories to minimize global code and enhance maintainability.
